        <b>Abstract:</b>
         
        In this paper we consider semigroups S(r,n) defined by the presentations for Fibonacci
        groups F(r,n). We prove that S(r,n) is a union
        of a finite number of copies of F(r,n).
        We also consider semigroups S(r,n,k) defined by the presentations
        for generalised Fibonacci groups F(r,n,k).
        We show that if gcd(n,k)=1 or gcd(n,r+k-1)=1 then again
        S(r,n,k) is a union of a finite number of copies of F(r,n,k).
        Finally we show that S(2,6,3) is infinite although
        F(2,6,3) is finite.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
         
        Computer based techniques for recognizing finitely presented groups are
        quite powerful. Tools available for this purpose are outlined. A general computational
        approach for investigating finitely presented groups by way of quotients and subgroups
        is described and examples are presented. The techniques can provide detailed
        information about group structure. Under suitable circumstances a finitely 
        presented group can be shown to be soluble and its complete derived series
        can be determined, using what is in effect a soluble quotient algorithm.

        This paper considers a number of questions posed by John Leech thirty 
        years ago regarding quotients of the triangle group (2, 3, 7) which have remained 
        unanswered, We provide answers to three of these and throw some light on a fourth 
        one, which appears to be quite difficult. We examine a few related results. Our 
        approach is mostly computational, using machine implementations of coset 
        enumeration techniques.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
         The purpose of this paper is first to give a survey of some
        recent results concerning semigroup presentations, and then
        to prove a new result which enables us to describe the structure
        of semigroups defined by certain presentations.
        The main theme is to relate the semigroup S defined by a
        presentation P to the group G defined by P. After
        mentioning a result of Adjan's giving a sufficient condition for
        S to embed in G, we consider some cases where S maps
        surjectively (but not necessarily injectively) onto G. In these
        examples, we find that S has minimal left and right ideals, and
        it turns out that this is a sufficient condition for S to map onto
        G. In this case, the kernel of S (i.e. the unique minimal two-sided
        ideal of S) is a disjoint union of pairwise isomorphic groups, and
        we describe a necessary and sufficient condition for these groups to
        be isomorphic to G.
        We then move on and expand on these results by proving a new result, which is a sort of rewriting theorem,
        enabling us to determine the presentations of the groups in the kernel
        in certain cases. We finish off by applying this new result to certain
        semigroup presentations and by pointing out its limitations.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
         Let P be a semigroup presentation, let S be the semigroup
        defined by P, and let G be the group defined by P.
        We prove that if S has both minimal left ideals and minimal right ideal, then
        the natural homomorphism f:S-&gtG; is onto. The restriction of f
        to a maximal subgroup H of the minimal two-sided ideal I of S
        is a group epimorphism. We prove that this restriction is an isomorphism if
        and only if the idempotents of I are closed under multiplication.
        Finally, we apply the obtained results to describe the structure
        of the semigroups defined by a semigroup variant of (l,m,n)-presentations.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
         Let S be a finitely presented semigroup having a minimal
        left ideal L and a minimal right ideal R. 
        The main result gives a presentation for the group R intersection L.
        It is obtained by rewriting the relations of S,
        using the actions of S on its minimal left and 
        minimal right ideals.
        This allows the structure of the minimal two-sided ideal
        of S to be described explicitly in terms of a Rees matrix semigroup.
        These results are applied to the Fibonacci semigroups,
        proving the conjecture that S(r,n,k) is infinite
        if g.c.d.(n,k)&gt;1 and g.c.d.(n,r+k-1)&gt;1.
        Two enumeration procedures, related to rewriting the presentation of
        S into a presentation for R intersection L, are described.
        The first enumerates the minimal left and minimal right ideals
        of S, and gives the actions of S on these ideals.
        The second enumerates the idempotents of the minimal two-sided 
        ideal of S.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
         In this paper we develop a general method for
        finding presentations for subsemigroups of semigroups defined
        by presentations. This method is based on the idea of
        rewriting, akin to the Reidemeister-Schreier method for groups.
        We also give two applications of this method.
        The first gives a presentation for a two-sided ideal of a semigroup, and implies
        that a two-sided ideal of finite index in a finitely presented semigroup is
        itself finitely presented. The second gives a presentation for the Schutzenberger group
        of a 0-minimal two-sided ideal, and implies that this group is finitely 
        presented if the ideal contains either finitely many 0-minimal left ideals
        or finitely many 0-minimal right ideals.

        giving an explicit presentation for a 3-generator, 3-relator group of order 131072

        <b>Abstract:</b>
         Subsemigroups and ideals of free products of 
        semigroups are studied with respect to the properties
        of being finitely generated or finitely presented. 
        It is proved that the free product
        of any two semigroups, at least one of which is
        non-trivial, contains a two-sided ideal which is not
        finitely generated as a semigroup, and also contains
        a subsemigroup which is finitely generated but not finitely
        presented. By  way of contrast, in the free
        product of two trivial semigroups, every
        subsemigroup is finitely generated and finitely presented.
        Further, it is proved 
        that an ideal of a free product of finitely presented
        semigroups, which is finitely generated as a semigroup,
        is also finitely presented. It is not known whether
        one-sided ideals of free products have the same
        property, but it is shown that they do
        when the free factors are free commutative.

        closely related to the orthogonal groups. We examine cases of finite groups in
        such series and look in detail at an infinite group with such a presentation. We
        prove some theoretical results about 3-generator symmetric presentations and
        make a number of conjectures regarding n-generator symmetric presentations.

         A method for finding presentations for subsemigroups

        used  to investigate when ideals are finitely presented. It is shown that
        an ideal of  a finitely presented semigroup

        By way of contrast,
