<p>

<b>(a)</b> Taking <i>n</i> = 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, ... gives a subsequence (<sup>&#8730;3</sup>/<sub>2</sub> , 0  , <sup>&#8730;3</sup>/<sub>2</sub> , 0 , ... ) which does not converge. Hence the original sequence does not converge.<br>
<b>(b)</b> The subsequence of even terms&#8594; 1 and the subsequence of odd terms&#8594; -1 and so (since the limits of subsequences of a convergent sequence are the same as the limit of the sequence) the sequence is not convergent.
