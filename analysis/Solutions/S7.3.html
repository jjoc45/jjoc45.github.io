The graph of the floor function is:<br>
To show this is discontinuous at any <i>k</i> &#8712; <b>Z</b>, look at a sequence (<i>k</i> - <sup>1</sup>/<sub><i>n</i></sub>) approximating <i>k</i> from above and argue as in Question 1.<br>
To see that it is continuous at any other point, use the fact that if <i>x</i> is not an integer, then the nearest integer is at least <i>&#948;</i> away from <i>x</i> for some 0 &#8804; <i>&#948;</i> &#8804; <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>. Then on the interval (<i>x</i> - <i>&#948;</i>, <i>x</i> + <i>&#948;</i>) the function is constant and hence continuous.<br>

The [<i>x</i>] function (though be careful, because different references are by no means consistent!) is "<i>x</i> rounded towards zero and so has a graph:

The proof is similar to that above.<br>

The fractional part {<i>x</i>} can be written as {<i>x</i>} = <i>x</i> - [<i>x</i>] and so has the same points of discontinuity as [<i>x</i>].
