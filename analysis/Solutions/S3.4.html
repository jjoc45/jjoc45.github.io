The reals in (0, 1) whose first decimal digit &#8800; 9 form the interval (0.00... , 0.900...) which is an interval of length <sup>9</sup>/<sub>10</sub>.<br>
Reals with first and second decimal digits &#8800; 9 form a union of intervals (0.000... , 0.0900...) &#8746; (0.100... , 0.1900...) &#8746; ... &#8746; (0.800... , 0.8900...) which is a union of 9 intervals each of length <sup>9</sup>/<sub>100</sub>.<br>
Reals with first, second and third decimal digits &#8800; 9 form a union of 9<sup>2</sup> intervals each of length <sup>9</sup>/<sub>1000</sub>, etc.<br>
Reals with first, second, ... , <i>n</i>th decimal digits &#8800; 9 form a union of 9<sup><i>n</i>-1</sup> intervals each of length 9 /10<sup><i>n</i></sup> with total length (9/10)<sup><i>n</i></sup>.<br>
As <i>n</i>&#8594; &#8734; this length becomes arbitrarily small and so the set of reals with no 9 in its decimal expansion has measure zero.

You can visualise this in a different way by thinking how you would choose a "random" real number in the unit interval. You could, for example, roll a 10-sided dice infinitely often to generate its decimal expansion. What would be the chance of <i>never</i> getting a 9 when doing this?
