(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The sequence (0.49, 0.499, 0.4999, ... )&#8594; 0.5 and applying <i>f</i> gives (0.9, 0.9, 0.99, 0.99, ... )&#8594; 1.0 while <i>f</i>(0.5) = 0. Hence <i>f</i> is not continuous at 0.5. In fact, a similar proof shows that <i>f</i> is not continuous at <i>any terminating decimal</i> -- though it is continuous at all other points.

(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply <i>g</i> to the same sequence to give (0.50111... , 0.500111... , 0.5000111... , ... ) which converges to 0.5. However, <i>g</i>(0.5) = 0.6111... which is different and so <i>g</i> is discontinuous at 0.5.

(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;This map is actually the map <i>h</i>(<i>x</i>) = 1 - <i>x</i> as you can see most easily by writing 1 as 0.9999... . Hence it <i>is</i> continuous everywhere.
