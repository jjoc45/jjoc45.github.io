<dl><dt><b><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Bernoulli_Johann.html">Johann Bernoulli</a></b> (1718)<br>
<dd>I call a function of a variable magnitude a quantity composed in any manner whatsoever from this variable magnitude and from constants.
<p align=justify>
<dt><b><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Euler.html">Euler</a></b> (1748)<br>
<dd>A function of a variable quantity is an analytic expression composed in any way whatsoever of the variable quantity and numbers or constant quantities.
<p align=justify>
<dt><b><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Euler.html">Euler</a></b> (1775)<br>
<dd>When quantities depend on each other in such a way that [the former] undergo changes themselves when [the latter] change, the [the former] are called functions of [the latter]. This is a very comprehensive idea which includes in itself all the ways in which one quantity can be determined by others.
<p align=justify>
<dt><b><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Lacroix.html">Lacroix</a></b> (1810)<br>
<dd>Every quantity whose value depends on one or more quantities is called a function of these latter, whether one knows or is ignorant of what operations it is necessary to use to arrive from the latter to the first.
<p align=justify>
<dt><b><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Fourier.html">Fourier</a></b> (1822)<br>
<dd>In general the function <i>f</i> (<i>x</i>) represents a succession of values or ordinates each of which is arbitrary. An infinity of values being given to the abscissa <i>x</i>, there is an equal number of ordinates <i>f</i> (<i>x</i>). All have actual numerical values, either positive or negative or null. We do not suppose these ordinates to be subject to a common law; they succeed each other in any manner whatever, and each of them is given as if it were a single quantity.
<p align=justify>
<dt><b><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Heine.html">Heine</a></b> (1872)<br>
<dd>A single-valued function of a variable <i>x</i> is an expression which for every single rational or irrational value of <i>x</i> is uniquely determined.
<p align=justify>
<dt><b><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Dedekind.html">Dedekind</a></b> (1888)<br>
<dd>A function <i>&#966;</i> on a set <i>S</i> is a law according to which to every determinate element <i>s</i> of <i>S</i> there belongs a determinate thing which is called the transform of <i>s</i> and denoted <i>&#966;</i>(<i>s</i>).<br>
