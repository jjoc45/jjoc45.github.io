<h2><font color=blue>Dedekind cuts</font></h2>
<p>
The first construction of the Real numbers from the Rationals is due to the German mathematician <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Dedekind.html">Richard Dedekind</a> (1831 - 1916). He developed the idea first in 1858 though he did not publish it until 1872. This is what he wrote at the beginning of the article.
<blockquote><p align=justify>
<i>As professor in the Polytechnic School in Z&uuml;rich I found myself for the first time obliged to lecture upon the ideas of the differential calculus and felt more keenly than ever before the lack of a really scientific foundation for arithmetic. In discussing the notion of the approach of a variable magnitude to a fixed limiting value, and especially in proving the theorem that every magnitude which grows continuously but not beyond all limits, must certainly approach a limiting value, I had recourse to geometric evidences. ... This feeling of dissatisfaction was so overpowering that I made the fixed resolve to keep mediating on the question till I should find a purely arithmetic and perfectly rigorous foundation for the principles of infinitesimal analysis.</i>

He defined a real number to be a pair (<i>L</i>, <i>R</i>) of sets of rationals which have the following properties.<br>
<ol type=a><li a> Every rational is in exactly one of the sets<br>
<li b> Every rational in <i>L</i> is &lt; every rational in <i>R</i><br>
</ol>
Such a pair is called a <b>Dedekind cut</b> (<i>Schnitt</i> in German). You can think of it as defining a real number which is the least upper bound of the "Left-hand set" <i>L</i> and also the greatest lower bound of the "right-hand set" <i>R</i>. If the cut defines a rational number then this may be in either of the two sets.<br>
It is rather a rather long (and tedious) task to define the arithmetic operations and order relation on such cuts and to verify that they do then satisfy the axioms for the Reals -- including even the Completeness Axiom.

<a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Dedekind.html">Richard Dedekind</a>, along with <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Riemann.html">Bernhard Riemann</a> was the last research student of <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Gauss.html">Gauss</a>. His arithmetisation of analysis was his most important contribution to mathematics, but was not enthusiastically received by leading mathematicians of his day, notably <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Kronecker.html">Kronecker</a> and <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Weierstrass.html">Weierstrass</a>. His ideas were, however, warmly welcomed by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Jordan.html">Jordan</a> and especially by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Cantor.html">Cantor</a> with whom he became firm friends.
