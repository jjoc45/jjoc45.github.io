<dl><dt><b><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Leibniz.html">Leibniz</a></b> (1684)<br>
<dd>If any continuous transition is proposed terminating in a certain limit, then it is possible to form a general reasoning, which covers also the final limit.
<p align=justify>
<dt><b><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Newton.html">Newton</a></b> (1687)<br>
<dd>The ultimate ratio of evanescent quantities ... [are] limits towards which the ratios of quantities decreasing without limit do always converge; and to which they approach nearer than by any given difference, but never go beyond, nor in effect attain to, till the quantities are diminished <i>in infinitem</i>.
<p align=justify>
<dt><b><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Maclaurin.html">Maclaurin</a></b> (1742)<br>
<dd>The ratio of 2<i>x</i> + <i>o</i> to <i>a</i> continually decreases while <i>o</i> decreases and is always greater than the ratio of 2<i>x</i> to <i>a</i> while <i>o</i> is any real increment, but it is manifest that it continually approaches to the ratio of 2<i>x</i> to <i>a</i> as its limit.
<p align=justify>
<dt><b><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/DÕAlembert.html">DÕAlembert</a></b> (1754)<br>
<dd>The ratio [<i>a</i> : 2<i>y</i> + <i>z</i>] is always greater than <i>a</i> : 2<i>y</i>, but the smaller <i>z</i> is, the greater the ratio will be and, since one may choose <i>z</i> as small as one pleases, the ratio <i>a</i> : 2<i>y</i> + <i>z</i> can be brought as close to the ratio <i>a</i> : 2<i>y</i> as we like. Consequently, <i>a</i> : 2<i>y</i> is the limit of the ratio <i>a</i> : 2<i>y</i> + <i>z</i>.

<dt><b><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Lacroix.html">Lacroix</a></b> (1806)<br>
<dd>The limit of the ratio (<i>u</i><sub>1</sub> - <i>u</i>)/<i>h</i> ... is the value towards which this ratio tends in proportion as the quantity h diminishes, and to which it may approach as near as we choose to make it.
<p align=justify>
<dt><b><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Cauchy.html">Cauchy</a></b> (1821)<br>
<dd>If the successive values attributed to the same variable approach indefinitely a fixed value, such that they finally differ from it by as little as one wishes, this latter is called the limit of all the others.<br>
