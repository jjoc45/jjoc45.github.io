Hence the three perpendicular bisectors would be coincident at <i>P</i>.<br>If the triangles were related by a translation then the three perpendicular bisectors would be parallel.<br>If the triangles were related by a glide reflection or reflection, then the midpoints of <i>AA</i>', <i>BB</i>' and <i>CC</i>' would all lie on the "mirror line".<br><p></body></html><p>
