Classifying them we get a translation (by a vector <i>BC</i>), two rotations (by &#177;120&#176;) about <i>C</i> and <i>R</i> and the compositions of the translation with the reflections, giving one reflection (in <i>CR</i>) and two glide reflections (in <i>PT</i> and <i>QS</i>). <p align=justify><p></body></html><p>
