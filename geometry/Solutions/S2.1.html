If <i>&#955;</i> = +1 then <i>T</i> has a fixed vector <b><i>a</i></b> and acts like an element of <i>O</i>(2) in the plane perpendicular to <b><i>a</i></b>.<br>If it acts as a rotation here, then we have a rotation in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>. (case (a))<br>If it acts as a reflection in a vector <b><i>b</i></b> here, then we have a reflection in the plane containing <b><i>a</i></b> and <b><i>b</i></b>. (case (b))<br>If <i>T</i> has no positive eigenvalue then as above we have <i>&#955;</i> = -1 with eigenvector <b><i>c</i> </b>. As before <i>T</i> acts as an element of <i>O</i>(2) in the plane perpendicular to <b><i>c</i> </b> and it cannot act as a reflection here otherwise it would have a fixed vector (which would be an eigenvector of +1). Hence it acts as a rotation in this plane and we have case (c).<br><img src= ../Diagrams/xproofend.gif align = right><br clear=right><br>i) The product of two reflections (which have determinant -1) has determinant +1 and so is a rotation. Since the vector <b><i>b</i></b> is fixed, it is a rotation about <b><i>b</i></b>.<p align=justify>ii) This is case (c): rotation by &#960; about the <i>z</i>-axis followed by reflection in the (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)-plane.<p align=justify>iii) Products of rotations are always rotations since <i>SO</i>(3) is a subgroup and so we have case (b).<br>Seeing what the axis is can be rather tricky. For example, rotation (by &#960;/2 anticlockwise) about the <i>x</i>-axis, followed by rotation about the <i>y</i>-axis followed by rotation about the <i>z</i>-axis is rotation by &#960;/2 about the <i>y</i>-axis.<p align=justify><p></body></html><p>
