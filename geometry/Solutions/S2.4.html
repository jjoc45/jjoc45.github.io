So there are eight symmetries in all.<br>These are: translation by a vector parallel to <i>AX</i>, rotations by &#960; about <i>O</i> and by &#960;/2 about the points <i>P</i>, <i>Q</i> and four glide reflections along the dotted lines.<p align=justify>You can see this a different way by observing that the symmetries mapping one square to the other can be obtained by composing (say) the translation by the symmetries that map the second square to itself. That is <i>T</i><sub><i>AX</i></sub>&#8728;<i>D</i><sub>4</sub>, where the dihedral group acts fixing the centre of <i>XYZT</i>.<br><br clear=right><p align=justify><p></body></html><p>
