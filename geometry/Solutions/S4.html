Let <i>g</i> be any isometry that maps <b><i>a</i></b> to <b><i>b</i></b>. (for example <i>T</i><sub><b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i></b></sub>)<br>Then <i>r</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>g</i> <sup>-1</sup><i>r</i><sub>1</sub><i>g</i> (just check the fixed point.) and so <i>B</i> = <i>g</i> <sup>-1</sup><i>Ag</i> as required.<br>By definition the subgroups <i>C</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> are generated by such rotations and so are conjugate.<br>To prove that any two copies of <i>D</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> are conjugate, suppose that they are generated by rotations about points <b><i>a</i></b><sub><i>i</i></sub> and reflections in lines <i>l</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> containing <b><i>a</i></b><sub><i>i</i></sub> for <i>i</i> = 1, 2.<br>This time choose a symmetry which maps <b><i>a</i></b><sub>1</sub> &#8614; <b><i>a</i></b><sub>2</sub> and <i>l</i><sub>1</sub> &#8614; <i>l</i><sub>2</sub> (for example, <i>T</i><sub><b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i></b></sub> followed by a suitable rotation about <b><i>b</i></b>) and proceed as before.<br>[Note that Leonardo's Theorem is really a classification of the finite subgroups of <i>O</i>(2) <i>up to conjugacy</i> by elements of <i>O</i>(2) .]<br>Since conjugation by any element preserves the determinant, we cannot have <i>D</i><sub>1</sub> (determinant = -1) conjugate to <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> (determinant = +1).<p align=justify><p><li>If a subgroup of <i>I</i>(<b>R</b>) contained translations by arbitrarily small amounts it would not be discrete. Hence there is a translation <i>T</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> by some smallest number <i>m</i>. Then if there is a translation <i>T</i><sub><i>k</i></sub> by an amount which was not a multiple of <i>m</i>, we could write <i>k</i> = <i>am</i> + <i>r</i> with |<i>r</i>| &lt; |<i>m</i>| and <i>T</i><sub><i>r</i></sub> would also be in the subgroup, giving a contradiction.<p align=justify><p><li>If the subgroup is generated by the smallest translation <i>T</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> then it is an infinite cyclic group <i>C</i><sub>&#8734;</sub> (&#8773; <b>Z</b> under +). <br>Otherwise it will also contain a reflection and conjugating this reflection by the smallest translation will give a reflection in a different point and it may then be generated by these two reflections whose product will be the translation.<p align=justify>The frieze groups (i) and (ii) are each generated by a single element of infinite order and hence are &#8773; <i>C</i><sub>&#8734;</sub>. <br>Note that although the two subgroups are isomorphic as groups, they are not conjugate subgroups in the group of all symmetries of the strip.<br>The group (iii) is generated by a translation and an element of order 2 (reflection in the horizontal) which commutes with the translation and hence is <i>C</i><sub>&#8734;</sub> &#215; <i>D</i><sub>1</sub>.<br>The group (iv) is generated by a pair of reflections (one through the centre of each symmetric motif and the other between each pair of motifs). <br>The group (v) is generated by a pair of elements of order 2 (this time half turns, one about the centre of each motif and the other about a point between each pair of motifs). <br>The group (vi) is generated by a pair of elements of order 2 (a reflection through the centre of each motif and a half turn about a point between each pair of motifs). <br>The group (vii) is generated by the same pair of elements as in any of the previous three cases (giving the group <i>D</i><sub>&#8734;</sub>) together with reflection in the horizontal which commutes with everything else. Hence the group is &#8773; <i>D</i><sub>&#8734;</sub> &#215; <i>D</i><sub>1</sub>.<p align=justify><p><li>Inversion in <b><i>a</i></b> is a rotatory reflection: reflection in any plane followed by rotation by &#960; about an axis perpendicular to the plane.<br>Following this with a rotation about the same axis gives a rotatory reflection. Hence any rotatory inversion is a rotatory reflection.<br>The converse works similarly.<p align=justify><p><li><ol type=i><li i> To check the homomorphism property <i>&#952;</i>(<i>AB</i>) = <i>&#952;</i>(<i>A</i>) <i>&#952;</i>(<i>B</i>) for all <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> &#8712; <i>O</i>(3) we must verify that <i>det</i>(<i>AB</i>) <i>AB</i> = <i>det</i>(<i>A</i>) <i>A</i> <i>det</i>(<i>B</i>) <i>B</i> and that <i>det</i>(<i>AB</i>) = <i>det</i>(<i>A</i>) <i>det</i>(<i>B</i>). The second of these is the standard property of the determinant while the first follows from the fact that multiplication by the scalar <i>det</i>(<i>B</i>) (which is &#177;1) commutes with the matrix <i>A</i>.<br>It is easy to check that <i>&#952;</i> is a bijection.<p align=justify><li ii>The full symmetry group of <i>X</i> (which is a subgroup of <i>O</i>(3)) is mapped by <i>&#952;</i> to a subgroup of <i>SO</i>(3) &#215; &lt; <i>J</i> >.<br>[Note that <i>&#952;</i>(<i>J</i>) = (<i>I</i>, -1) which is why we take <i>J</i> as the generator of the second factor.]<br>This subgroup is the group <i>S</i><sub><i>d</i></sub>(<i>X</i>) &#215; &lt; <i>J</i> >.<br></ol><br></ol><p><center><form ><input type="button" onclick="window.close()" value="Close this window"></form></center></body></html><p>
