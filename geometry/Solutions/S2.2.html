In fact, reflections in <i>any</i> pair of lines at an angle of <i>&#952;</i>/2 will give the same result.<br><img src= ../Diagrams/xproofend.gif align = right><br clear=right><br>In the last question we showed that an element of <i>O</i>(3) is either a reflection , a rotation by <i>&#952;</i> about some axis <b><i>a</i></b> (in which case it can be written as a production of two reflections in planes meeting in <b><i>a</i></b> at an angle of <i>&#952;</i>/2) or a rotatory reflection (in which it can be as the product of three reflections).<br><img src= ../Diagrams/xproofend.gif align = right><br clear=right><br><p></body></html><p>
