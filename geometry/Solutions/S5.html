It is the <i>cuboctahedron</i>.<p align=justify>The dual of the truncated octahedron has 24 triangular faces which careful consideration shows to come together to form 12 rhomboidal faces and so the dual is the <i>rhombic dodecahedron</i>.<p align=justify>The truncated octahedron and and the rhombic dodecahedron are particularly important because copies of them can be used to fill up <b>R</b><sup>3</sup> without any gaps. Consequently, they appear "in nature" as crystals of various chemical compounds. With the obvious exception of the cube, none of the other Platonic solids can do this.<p align=justify><p><li><img src= ../Diagrams/xS5-1.gif align = right>The stella octangula has 24 faces, 8 vertices with 3 incident edges and 6 vertices with 8 incident edges. Hence its dual solid has 24 vertices, 8 triangular faces and 6 octagonal faces. It is a truncated cube:<br><br clear=right><br>Hence the symmetry groups of the stella octangular are the same as those of the cube/octahedron.<br><i>S</i><sub><i>d</i></sub> &#8773; <i>S</i><sub>4</sub> and <i>S</i> &#8773; <i>S</i><sub>4</sub> &#215; &lt; <i>J</i> &gt; .<p align=justify>Colouring the two tetrahedra differently reduces the symmetry groups to those of the tetrahedron: <i>S</i><sub><i>d</i></sub> &#8773; <i>A</i><sub>4</sub> and <i>S</i> &#8773; <i>S</i><sub>4</sub>. <br>Colouring the top and bottom of the dual truncated cube differently from the others will give a figure whose rotational symmetry group <i>S</i><sub><i>d</i></sub> &#8773; <i>D</i><sub>4</sub> (the rotational symmetries of the square half-way up) and whose full symmetry group is <i>S</i> &#8773; <i>D</i><sub>4</sub> &#215; &lt; <i>J</i> &gt; .<br>Colouring the upper and lower faces or edges of the stellar octangula will have the same effect.<p align=justify><p><li>The direct symmetry group <i>S</i><sub><i>d</i></sub>(<i>F</i>) is the same as the group of rotational symmetries of the triangle half-way along and so is <i>D</i><sub>3</sub> . Since <i>J</i> is not a symmetry of <i>F</i> and <i>F</i> does have some non-rotational symmetries, the full symmetry group of <i>F</i> is a <i>mixed group</i> and the only possibility is <i>D</i><sub>6</sub><i>D</i><sub>3</sub> .<p align=justify>The direct symmetries of <i>F</i><sub>1</sub> are the rotational symmetries of the "mid-rhombus" and hence the group <i>S</i><sub><i>d</i></sub>(<i>F</i><sub>1</sub>) &#8773; <i>D</i><sub>2</sub> . <br>Since <i>J</i> is a symmetry of <i>F</i><sub>1</sub> the full symmetry group <i>S</i>(<i>F</i><sub>1</sub>) &#8773; <i>D</i><sub>2</sub> &#215; &lt; J > .<p align=justify>Any rotational symmetry of <i>F</i><sub>2</sub> must be a rotational symmetry of the horizontal square and the only possible ones are rotation by &#960; about a vertical axis through the centre or rotation by &#960; about either of the diagonals. <br>Hence <i>S</i><sub><i>d</i></sub>(<i>F</i><sub>2</sub>) &#8773; <i>D</i><sub>2</sub> .<p align=justify>Since <i>J</i> is not a symmetry of <i>F</i><sub>2</sub> but <i>F</i><sub>2</sub> does have some opposite symmetries, the full symmetry group is a mixed group and hence we have <i>S</i>(<i>F</i><sub>2</sub>) &#8773; <i>D</i><sub>4</sub><i>D</i><sub>2</sub> .<p align=justify><p><li>As in the last question, the direct symmetries of <i>P</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> are the rotational symmetries of the regular <i>n</i>-gon (or <i>dihedron</i>, if you like) half-way down the prism. This is the same as the full symmetry group <i>D</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> of the regular <i>n</i>-gon in <b>R</b><sup>2</sup> (where the elements of order 2 are reflections rather than rotations by &#960;).<br>If <i>n</i> is even, then <i>P</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> is centrally symmetric (and has <b><i>x</i></b> &#8614; -<b><i>x</i></b> as a symmetry) and so the full symmetry group is <i>D</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> &#215; &lt; <i>J</i> &gt; . If <i>n</i> is odd, then, as in the last question, the full symmetry group is the mixed group <i>D</i><sub>2<i>n</i></sub><i>D</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> .<p align=justify>The rotational group of the square antiprism consists of 4 rotations about the line joining the centres of the squares (including the identity!) and 4 rotations by &#960; about lines joining the centres of opposite triangles. <br>The group <i>S</i><sub><i>d</i></sub> &#8773; <i>D</i><sub>4</sub> .<br>(If you cut the antiprism by a plane halfway up you get a regular octagon and some of the symmetries of this are symmetries of the solid.)<br>The square antiprism is not centrally symmetric and so its full symmetry group is a mixed group which must be <i>D</i><sub>8</sub><i>D</i><sub>4</sub> .<p align=justify></ol></body></html>
