It was studied extensively in several ancient civilisations and in particular, the Greeks used it to lay the foundations of our modern "axiomatic" treatment of mathematics.<p align=justify>In particular, in the most influencial mathematical work of all time, the <i>Elements</i> of <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Euclid.html">Euclid</a> (born about 325 BC) described what we can think of as a model for plane geometry. <br>This started with a set of <i>undefined notions</i> including a <i>point</i>, a <i>straight line</i>, a <i>circle</i>.<br>In addition Euclid described <i>five postulates</i> which allowed him to develop the theory from these elementary ideas. These were supposed to be properties of the plane which were in some sense self-evident.<br>Here are the five he defined.<br><ol><li 1>A straight line can be drawn from any point to any other.<br><li 2>A finite straight line can be extended continuously in a straight line.<br><li 3>A circle may be described with any centre and any radius.<br><li 4>A right angles are equal.<br><li 5>If a straight line meets two others so that the sum of the interior angles is less than two right angles, then one may extend the lines to meet on this side.<br></ol>Euclid defined some other logical axioms to allow him to deduce results from these postulates. These include such notions as:<blockquote><p align=justify><i>Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other.</i></blockquote><p align=justify>Euclid left various other ideas like <i>length</i>, <i>distance</i> or the <i>magnitude of an angle</i> undefined and also assumed various other postulates without stating them explicitly. For example, he did not define what it means for a line to be straight or what it means for a point on a straight line to lie between two others. In fact to define an adequate model for plane geometry (or plane Euclidean geometry as it became called) requires a much more complicated set of postulates and this was not all cleared up until much later at the end of the 19th Century.<p align=justify>In the above set of postulates, it is clear that the fifth postulate has a rather different character to the others and right from the beginning mathematicians made strenuous efforts to deduce it from the others. By the 19th Century several different mathematicians including <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Gauss.html">Gauss</a>, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Bolyai.html">Bolyai</a> and <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Lobachevsky.html">Lobachevsky</a> realised that one could define consistent geometries by <i>denying</i> the fifth postulate. Their constructions came to be called non-Euclidean geometries. When they were first introduced they were regarded with great suspicion by other mathematicians.<p align=justify>You can see <a href=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Non-Euclidean_geometry.html>an article about the history of non-Euclidean geometry</a><p align=justify>It was in the context of these new and controversial geometries that the German mathematician <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Klein.html">Felix Klein</a> described a different way of thinking about geometry. In 1872 (at the age of 23) in his <i>Erlangen Program</i> he outlined the principle that a geometry is determined by its <i>group of allowable transformations</i>. <br>In this course we will concentrate on this link with group theory.<p><center><hr><table border=0 bgcolor="cyan" width=80% cellspacing=0><tr><td align=center width=40%><a href = "../index.html">Previous page</a><br>(Contents)  <td align=center width=20%><a href = "../index.html">Contents</a><td align=center width=40%><a href = "L1.html">Next page</a><br>(Foundations)</table><hr></center><font fontsize=-1 color=red>JOC February 2003</font></body></html><p>
