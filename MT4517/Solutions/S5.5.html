Starting with any non-zero matrix and multiplying on the left and right by other "elementary matrices" (ones with one 1 and 3 zeros) will let you get a non-zero entry in any of the four positions. Then multiplying by scalar matrices and adding will let you get any matrix. Hence an ideal which contains any non-zero matrix must contain them all. So the ring has only two ideals {0} and <i>R</i>.<br>
A similar proof shows that any matrix ring with field entries is simple. (Where did we use the fact that the entries were from a field?)
