<h2><font color=blue>Solution 4.3</font></h2>
<p>

As groups 2<b>Z</b> and 3<b>Z</b> are both infinite cyclic groups generated by 2 and 3 respectively.<br>
Any ring homomorphism would have to take an additive generator to an additive generator and thus map 2 to &#177;3. However 2<sup>2</sup> = 4 would then have to map to 6 &#8800; (&#177;3)<sup>2</sup>.
<p align=justify>
A suitable group isomorphism is 1 &#8614; (1, 1). Note that since 2, 3 are coprime the (additive) order of (1, 1) = 6.<br>
Then an element <i>a</i> = (1 + 1 + ... + 1) maps to (<i>a</i>, <i>a</i>) and <i>b</i> maps to (<i>b</i>, <i>b</i>). The product <i>ab</i> maps to (<i>ab</i>, <i>ab</i>) which is where it has to go to be a ring isomorphism.
<p align=justify>
More generally, the same proof works for any pair of integers <i>m</i>, <i>n</i> which are coprime.
