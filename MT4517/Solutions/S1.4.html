<img src= ../Diagrams/S1_1.gif align = right>As in the last question sums, differences and products of numbers of this form also have this form and the other axioms follow from those in <b>C</b>.<br>
The elements of <i>R</i> form an "equiangular lattice" as shown.<br>
Following the hint, the only invertible elements are those for which |<i>z</i>| = 1 since there are no non-zero elements inside the unit circle. Thus the invertible elements are the six ones indicated.<br>
