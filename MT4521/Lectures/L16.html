<h2><font color=blue>Projective spaces</font></h2>

We now set up a geometry based on a space different from <b>R</b><sup><i>n</i></sup>. 
<p align=justify>
Early Renaisance artists studied ideas of <i>perspective</i>. That is the problems of representing a three dimensional figure in a convincing way in two dimensions. These artists included <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Francesca.html">Piero della Francesca</a> (1412 to 1492) <i>De prospectiva pingendi</i>, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Alberti.html">Leone Alberti</a> (1404 to 1472) <i>Della pictura</i>, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Leonardo.html">Leonardo da Vinci</a> (1452 to 1519) etc. Indeed the Greek <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Anaxagoras.html">Anaxagoras of Clazomenae</a> (499BC to 428BC) may have written about perspective.
<p align=justify>
These ideas were developed into the notion of projective geometry which was studied in the 17th century by (among other) <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Desargues.html">Girard Desargues</a> (1591 to 1661).

We start with the correspondence between points on two lines given by projection from a point <i>P</i> not on either line.
<p align=justify>
<img src= ../Diagrams/x16-1.gif align = right>Unfortunately, this is not one-one. A line from <i>P</i> parallel to the line <i>m</i> does not meet <i>m</i> and so no point on <i>m</i> corresponds to the point <i>x</i> on <i>l</i>. Similarly no point on <i>l</i> corresponds to the point <i>y</i> on <i>m</i>.
<p align=justify>
To remedy this we add a <i>point at infinity</i> to each line. Then <i>x</i> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/goesto.gif" alt = "goesto"> &#8734;<sub><i>m</i></sub> and <i>y</i> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/goesto.gif" alt = "goesto"> &#8734;<sub><i>l</i></sub> .<br>
The space we get in this way consisting of the <i>ordinary</i> affine line <b>R</b> and this extra point is called the <i>Real projective line</i> and is written <b>R</b><i>P</i><sup>1</sup>.<br>
<br clear=right><br>
<img src= ../Diagrams/x16-2.gif align = right>Similarly we set up a correspondence between the points of two planes &#960;<sub>1</sub> and &#960;<sub>2</sub> .<br>
This time we add a <i>line at infinity</i> to each plane to make the correspondence into a bijection.<br>
This gives us a space consisting of the <i>ordinary</i> affine plane <b>R</b><sup>2</sup> together with this extra (projective) line at infinity which is called the <i>Real projective plane</i> and is written <b>R</b><i>P</i><sup>2</sup>.<br>
<br clear=right><br>
<b><font color=red>Remarks</font></b>
<p align=justify>
<ol><li 1>Note that we add a single point at infinity to make a projective line. Thus a <i>projective line</i> is really rather like  circle and when we add a line at infinity to the plane this is more like a <i>circle at infinity</i>. <br>
In dealing with infinity on an ordinary real line we think of there being two points at infinity: +&#8734; and -&#8734; since we can extend the line in two directions. 
<p align=justify>
<img src= ../Diagrams/x16-3.gif align = right>
<li 2>An ordinary line in the plane meets the line at infinity in its point at infinity. A pair of parallel lines meet at their (common) point at infinity. To see this, project so that the line at infinity becomes an ordinary line.<br>
<br clear=right><br>
<img src= ../Diagrams/x16-4.gif align = right>
<li 3>Figures related by projection are called <i>projectively equivalent</i>. For example, by thinking of a circular cone as corresponding to projection from the apex of the cone, one can see that any <i>conic section</i> (a parabola, ellipse or hyperbola) is projectively equivalent to a circle and hence any two conic sections are projectively equivalent.<br clear=right>
<p align=justify>
<li 4>One can add a single point at infinity to the complex plane and obtain what is called the <i>Riemann sphere</i>. This is then called (rather confusingly) the <i>Complex projective line</i> (since it has dimension 1 over <b>C</b>).<br>
