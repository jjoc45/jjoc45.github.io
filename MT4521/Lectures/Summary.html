A <b>Geometry</b> consists of a set <i>S</i> and a subgroup <i>G</i> of the group <i>Bij</i>(<i>S</i>) of all bijections from <i>S</i> to itself.
<p align=justify>
For Euclidean geometry, <i>S</i> = <b>R</b><sup><i>n</i></sup> and the group is the set <i>I</i>(<b>R</b><sup><i>n</i></sup>) of all length preserving maps or <b>isometries</b>.
<p align=justify>
Every element of <i>I</i>(<b>R</b><sup><i>n</i></sup>) is of the form <i>T</i><sub><b>a</b></sub> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/comp.gif" alt = "comp"> <i>L</i> with <i>T</i><sub><b>a</b></sub> a translation <b>x</b> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/goesto.gif" alt = "goesto"> <b>a</b> + <b>x</b> and <i>L</i> a length preserving linear map &#8712; <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>).<br>
Then <i>det</i>(<i>L</i>) = &#177;1. If <i>det</i>(<i>L</i>) = +1 the isometry is <b>direct</b>, otherwise it is <b>opposite</b>.
<p align=justify>
If <i>f</i> is a symmetry of the line:  <i>f</i> &#8712; <i>I</i>(<b>R</b>), then <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) = <i>a</i> + <i>x</i> or <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) = <i>a</i> - <i>x</i> and <i>f</i> is either a translation or reflection (in a point).
<p align=justify>
<i>Direct</i> isometries of the plane: <i>I</i>(<b>R</b><sup>2</sup>) are either <i>rotations</i> (about a point) or <i>translations</i>.<br>
<i>Opposite</i> symmetries of <b>R</b><sup>2</sup> are either <i>reflections</i> (in a line) or <i>glides</i> (a reflection in a line followed by translation parallel to the line).
<p align=justify>
<i>Direct</i> isometries of <b>R</b><sup>3</sup> are either <i>rotations</i> (about an <i>axis</i> in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>) or <i>translations</i> or <i>screws</i> (a rotation about a line followed by translation parallel to the line).<br>
<i>Opposite</i> symmetries of <b>R</b><sup>3</sup> are either <i>reflections</i> (in a plane) or <i>glides</i> (a reflection in a plane followed by translation parallel to the plane) or <i>rotatory reflections</i> (rotaion about a line followed by reflection in a plane perpendicular to the line).
<p align=justify>
A symmetry group of a figure <i>F</i> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/subset.gif" alt = "subset"> <b>R</b><sup><i>n</i></sup> is the set of all symmetries <i>f</i> in <i>I</i>(<b>R</b><sup><i>n</i></sup>) for which <i>f</i>(<i>F</i>) = <i>F</i>.
<p align=justify>
Finite subgroups of  <i>I</i>(<b>R</b><sup>2</sup>) are isomorphic either to <i>C</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> : a cyclic group of order <i>n</i> (generated by a rotation by 2&#960;/<i>n</i> about some point) or <i>D</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> : a dihedral group of order 2<i>n</i> (generated either by a similar rotation and one reflection in a line through the point, or by two such reflections) and this classifies the subgroups up to conjugacy inside the group  <i>I</i>(<b>R</b><sup>2</sup>).
<p align=justify>
Finite subgroups of  <i>I</i>(<b>R</b><sup>3</sup>) which consist only of direct symmetries are isomorphic either to <i>C</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> (generated by a rotation by 2&#960;/<i>n</i> about some axis) or <i>D</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> (a dihedral group of order 2<i>n</i> consisting of rotations as in the <i>C</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> case and rotations by &#960;) or to the rotational symmetry groups of one of the Platonic solids (<i>A</i><sub>4</sub> , <i>S</i><sub>4</sub> or <i>A</i><sub>5</sub>). 
<p align=justify>
A finite subgroup of <i>I</i>(<b>R</b><sup>3</sup>) which contains opposite symmetries is either a <i>direct product</i> of a direct symmetry group with the group of order 2 generated by the central inversion map <i>J</i>: <b>x</b> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/goesto.gif" alt = "goesto"> -<b>x</b> or a <i>mixed group</i>. A <b>mixed group</b> is denoted by a pair <i>H</i> <i>K</i> where <i>H</i> and <i>K</i> are direct symmetry groups and <i>K</i> is a subgroup of index 2 in <i>H</i>. The direct symmetries in the mixed group are the elements of <i>H</i> and the opposite symmetries are the composition of <i>J</i> with the elements of <i>K</i> - <i>H</i>.
<p align=justify>
<b>Affine geometry</b> is the geometry with group <i>A</i>(<b>R</b><sup><i>n</i></sup>) acting on the set <b>R</b><sup><i>n</i></sup>. The elements of this consist of compositions of translations with elements of <i>GL</i>(<i>n</i>, <b>R</b>). Affine transformations do not preserve length or angle, but do preserve ratios of segments on parallel lines.<br>
Many theorems of Euclidean geometry are in fact affine theorems. These include results like the concidence of the medians of a triangle, Ceva's theorem and Menelaus's theorem.
<p align=justify>
<b>Similarity geometry</b> lies between affine and Euclidean geometry. Its transformations are <i>similitudes</i> which consist of compositions of translations with linear maps of the form  <i>&#955;</i><i>L</i> with <i>L</i> &#8712; <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>) and <i>&#955;</i> &#8712; <b>R</b> - {0}. Such transformations preserve angles but stretch all lengths by the same amount.<br>
Theorems involving similar triangles are theorems of similarity geometry. 
<p align=justify>
The <b>Real projective line</b> <b>R</b><i>P</i><sup>1</sup> consists of the affine line <b>R</b> together with an extra <i>point at infinity</i>. <br>
The <b>Real projective plane</b> <b>R</b><i>P</i><sup>2</sup> consists of the affine plane <b>R</b><sup>2</sup> together with a <i>line at infinity</i>. 
<p align=justify>
The projective line is parametrised by pairs [<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>] of <b>homogeneous coordinates</b>. An ordinary (affine) point <i>x</i> has homogeneous cordinates [<i>x</i>, 1] and the point at infinity has homogeneous coordinates [1, 0]. 
<p align=justify>
The <i>projective transformations</i> acting on <b>R</b><i>P</i><sup>1</sup> are elements of the group <i>PGL</i>(2, <b>R</b>) which is the quotient group of the group <i>GL</i>(2, <b>R</b>) by the subgroup of scalar matrices <i>&#955;</i><i>I</i>. <br>
These transformations can be regarded as <i>rational maps</i> of the form <i>x</i> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/goesto.gif" alt = "goesto"> (<i>ax</i> + <i>b</i>)/(<i>cx</i> + <i>d</i>) with appropriate allowance for the point at infinity.
<p align=justify>
The <b>standard reference points</b> of  are &#8734;, 0, 1 ([1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1]) and there is a unique projective transformation taking any three distinct points to these reference points.<br>
Given four points <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i> in <b>R</b><i>P</i><sup>1</sup> let <i>&#952;</i> be the map taking <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> to &#8734;, 0, 1. Then the <b>cross-ratio</b> (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i> ; <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>) is defined to be <i>&#952;</i> (<i>d</i>). This cross-ratio is preserved by projective transformations. 
<p align=justify>
The projective plane <b>R</b><i>P</i><sup>2</sup> is parametrised by homogeneous coordinates [<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>]. Its group of transformations is <i>PGL</i>(3, <b>R</b>).<br>
These transformations preserve the cross-ratio of any four points on a line. Any two such <i>ranges</i> on different lines which are related by projection from a point not on either line have the same cross-ratio. One may also define the cross-ratio of a <i>pencil</i> of four lines (four lines through a common point).
<p align=justify>
One may use the freedom to project some points to (say) infinity to simplify diagrams and deduce projective theorems from simple Euclidean results. Some examples are the harmonic property of a complete quadrangle, Desargues' theorem, Pappus's theorem.
<p align=justify>
<b>Topology</b> is the study of properties invariant under continuous deformation.
<p align=justify>
Spaces are <b>homeomorphic</b> if there is a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse between them.
<p align=justify>
A <b>surface</b> is a space in which every point lies in an area homeomorphic to a disc in <b>R</b><sup>2</sup>.
<p align=justify>
Examples of surfaces include spheres, tori, Klein bottles and Real projective planes. Surfaces like cylinders or M&ouml;bius bands which are not closed are examples of <i>non-compact</i> surfaces.
<p align=justify>
More complicated surfaces can be made using the <b>connected sum construction</b> in which discs are removed from two surfaces and the pieces then joined by the free edges.
<p align=justify>
A compact surface can be constructed from a <b>planar model</b>: a polygon whose sides are matched in pairs. The matching can be described using an <i>edge word</i> which describes how the matched edges are located on the boundary.<br>
If every edge in the edge word is matched by its inverse, the surface is orientable. The edge word of a connected sum is constucted by concatenating the edges words of the individual surfaces.
<p align=justify>
The <b>Euler characteristic</b> <i>&#967;</i> of a surface is calculated by splitting the surface up into <i>F</i> regions (or faces), <i>E</i> edges and <i>V</i> vertices where <i>&#967;</i> = <i>F</i> - <i>E</i> + <i>V</i>. It is a topological invariant of the surface.
<p align=justify>
The <b>Classification Theorem</b> for compact connected surfaces states that if such a surface is orientable it is either a sphere or a connected sum of Tori: if non-orientable it is a connected sum of Projective planes.
<p align=justify>
We can use it to identify a surface from the edge word of a planar model by calculating the number of vertices on the boundary of the planar model.<br>
