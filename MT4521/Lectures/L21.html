<h2><font color=blue>Introduction to topology</font></h2>
<p>
<b>Topology</b> is (roughly) the study of properties invariant under "continuous transformation".
<p align=justify>
More formally:<br>
Let <i>S</i>, <i>T</i> be sets with a structure for which the idea of continuity makes sense. e.g. Subsets of <b>R</b><sup><i>n</i></sup>, metric spaces, ...<br>
Then a bijection <i>f</i> from <i>S</i> to <i>T</i> is called a <b>homeomorphism</b> or <b>topological isomorphism</b> if both <i>f</i> and <i>f</i><sup>-1</sup> are continuous. We then write <i>S</i> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/iso.gif" alt = "iso"> <i>T</i>.<br>
In <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Klein.html">Klein</a>'s formulation, the set of all such maps from a space to itself is a group and topology is the associated geometry.

<font color=red><b>Examples</b></font><br>
<ol><li 1>A line and a curve are homeomorphic:   <img src= ../Diagrams/x23-1.gif align = middle>
<p align=justify>
<li 2>A <b>circle</b> <i>S</i><sup>1</sup> and a <b>knot</b> <i>K</i> (subsets of <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>) are homeomorphic -- even though one cannot be deformed into the other (in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>). <img src= ../Diagrams/x23-2.gif align = middle><br>
Strangely, <b>R</b><sup>3</sup> - <i>S</i><sup>1</sup> and <b>R</b><sup>3</sup> - <i>K</i> are not homeomorphic.
<p align=justify>
<li 3>A closed (including its boundary) disc and closed unit square are homeomorphic. <img src= ../Diagrams/x23-3.gif align = middle>
<p align=justify>
<li 4>A <b>sphere</b> (the surface) and the <b>surface of a cube</b> are homeomorphic.  <img src= ../Diagrams/x23-4.gif align = middle><br>
<font color=green><b>"Proof"</b></font><br>
Put the cube at the centre of the sphere and project from the centre.
<p align=justify>
<li 5>A <b>sphere</b> and a <b>torus</b> are not homeomorphic.  <img src= ../Diagrams/x23-5.gif align = middle><br>
<font color=green><b>"Proof"</b></font><br>
Removing a circle from a sphere always splits it into two parts -- not so for the torus.
<p align=justify>
<li 6>A cylinder S1 &#215; I and the space made by gluing a strip after a full turn are homeomorphic -- even though (cf example 2) one cannot be deformed into the other.
<p align=justify>
<li 7>The <b>M&ouml;bius band</b> is a "space" made by gluing together the ends of a strip after a half turn. <img src= ../Diagrams/x23-6.gif align = middle>
<p align=justify>
<li 8>The <b>Real projective plane</b> <b>R</b><i>P</i><sup>1</sup> = {the set of lines through <b>0</b> in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>}<br>
If we take an "upper hemisphere", this meets each line in a unique point which we may take as the representative of that point of the projective plane -- except for opposite points on the equator which have to be "identified".  <img src= ../Diagrams/x23-7.gif align = middle><br>
Hence the Real Projective Plane can be regarded as a disc which opposite points on its boundary identified.
