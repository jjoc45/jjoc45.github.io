The dual of the rhombic dodecahedron has 6 square faces and 8 triangular faces. It is the <i>cuboctahedron</i>.
<p align=justify>
The dual of the truncated octahedron has 24 triangular faces which careful consideration shows to come together to form 12 rhomboidal faces and so the dual is the <i>rhombic dodecahedron</i>.
<p align=justify>
The truncated octahedron and and the rhombic dodecahedron are particularly important because copies of them can be used to fill up <b>R</b><sup>3</sup> without any gaps. Consequently, they appear "in nature" as crystals of various chemical compounds. With the obvious exception of the cube, none of the other Platonic solids can do this.
