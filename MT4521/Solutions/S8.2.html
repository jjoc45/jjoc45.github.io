Choose any point not on the first line <i>l</i> and join it to the first three points. Put in the second line <i>m</i> and adjust it so that two of the points are on the correct lines. Then tilt <i>m</i> until the third point lies on the correct line. You may have to experiment a bit to see how to do it if the points are (say) in different orders on the two lines.

In fact the converse of this result is true: any map from <b>R</b><i>P</i><sup>1</sup> to <b>R</b><i>P</i><sup>1</sup> given by projection from a point not on either line does give an element of <i>PGL</i>(2, <b>R</b>).<br>
