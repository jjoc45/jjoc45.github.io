Since a triangle is determined by the lengths of its sides, any map which preserves all lengths also maps all triangles congruently. But the triangle determines the size of its angles and so these too are preserved.

A map like (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) <img src= "../Symbolgifs/goesto.gif" alt = "goesto"> (2<i>x</i>, 2<i>y</i>) preserves angles but does not preserve lengths.
