<img src= ../Diagrams/xS2-3.gif align = right>Either argue as in the last question or observe that a rhombus has 4 symmetries to deduce that there are 4 symmetries mapping one rhombus to the other.<br>
These 4 can be thought of (for example) as the composition of any symmetry taking one rhombus to the other (say, horizontal translation followed by rotation by 90&#176;) and a self symmetry of the rhombus. 
<p align=justify>
Classifying them we get two rotations by 90&#176; about the centres of the squares (!) shown, together with two indirect symmetries: a glide reflection along the line joining the mid-points of <i>AD</i> and <i>TZ</i> and the corresponding line joining the mid-points of <i>AB</i> and <i>TX</i>. (These lines are at 45&#176; to the horizontal.)
