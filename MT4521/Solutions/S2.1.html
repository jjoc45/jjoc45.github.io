The proof is similar to the proof that <i>SO</i>(3) is the group of rotations in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>.<br>
An element <i>T</i> of <i>O</i>(3) has an eigenvalue which is either &#177;1. If <i>&#955;</i> = +1 then <i>T</i> has a fixed vector <b>a</b> and acts like an element of <i>O</i>(2) in the plane perpendicular to <b>a</b>.<br>
If it acts as a rotation here, then we have a rotation in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>. (case (a))<br>
If it acts as a reflection in a vector <b>b</b> here, then we have a reflection in the plane containing <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>. (case (b))<br>
If <i>T</i> has no positive eigenvalue then as above we have <i>&#955;</i> = -1 with eigenvector <b>c </b>. As before <i>T</i> acts as an element of <i>O</i>(2) in the plane perpendicular to <b>c </b> and it cannot act as a reflection here otherwise it would have a fixed vector (which would be an eigenvector of +1). Hence it acts as a rotation in this plane and we have case (c).<br>

(i) The product of two reflections (which have determinant -1) has determinant +1 and so is a rotation. Since the vector <b>b</b> is fixed, it is a rotation about <b>b</b>.
<p align=justify>
(ii) This is case (c): rotation by &#960; about the <i>z</i>-axis followed by reflection in the (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)-plane.
<p align=justify>
(iii) Products of rotations are always rotations since <i>SO</i>(3) is a subgroup and so we have case (b).<br>
Seeing what the axis is can be rather tricky. For example, rotation (by &#960;/2 anticlockwise) about the <i>x</i>-axis, followed by rotation about the <i>y</i>-axis followed by rotation about the <i>z</i>-axis is rotation by &#960;/2 about the <i>y</i>-axis.

(iv) Reflecting in three perpendicular planes gives the map <b>x</b> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/goesto.gif" alt = "goesto"> -<b>x</b> of (ii)
