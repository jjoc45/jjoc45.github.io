The direct symmetries of <i>P</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> are the rotational symmetries of the regular <i>n</i>-gon (or <i>dihedron</i>, if you like) half-way down the prism. This is the same as the full symmetry group <i>D</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> of the regular <i>n</i>-gon in <b>R</b><sup>2</sup> (where the elements of order 2 are reflections rather than rotations by &#960;).<br>
If <i>n</i> is even, then <i>P</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> is centrally symmetric (and has <b>x</b> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/goesto.gif" alt = "goesto"> -<b>x</b> as a symmetry) and so the full symmetry group is <i>D</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> &#215; &lt; <i>J</i> &gt; . If <i>n</i> is odd, then, as in the last question, the full symmetry group is the mixed group <i>D</i><sub>2<i>n</i></sub><i>D</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> .

The rotational group of the square antiprism consists of 4 rotations about the line joining the centres of the squares (including the identity!) and 4 rotations by &#960; about lines joining the centres of the edges joining the two squares. <br>
The group <i>S</i><sub><i>d</i></sub> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/iso.gif" alt = "iso"> <i>D</i><sub>4</sub> .<br>
(If you cut the antiprism by a plane halfway up you get a regular octagon and some of the symmetries of this are symmetries of the solid.)<br>
The square antiprism is not centrally symmetric and so its full symmetry group is a mixed group which must be <i>D</i><sub>8</sub><i>D</i><sub>4</sub> .
