(a) To get <i>C</i><sub>4</sub> as a symmetry group, put a symbol like <img src= ../Diagrams/x08-3.gif align = middle> whose 2-dimensional symmetry group is <i>C</i><sub>4</sub> on (say) the top face. <br>
(If you like, you can put its mirror image on the bottom face, but if you use the symbol on the bottom <i>without</i> reflecting it you'll get a <i>D</i><sub>4</sub>.)<br>
(b) Paint each pair of opposite faces the same colour and you'll get a <i>D</i><sub>2</sub>.<br>
(c) Paint a line on the top face and then rotate the cube by the appropriate amounts for <i>A</i><sub>4</sub> and paint the other faces to match what you get. (That's really the same as Question 2 above.)

<b>Question</b>: Can you mark a cube to get a <i>D</i><sub>3</sub> ? <b>Hint</b>: <i>D</i><sub>3</sub> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/iso.gif" alt = "iso"> <i>S</i><sub>3</sub> and remember what are permuted when you get the group <i>S</i><sub><i>d</i></sub>(<i>C</i>) as <i>S</i><sub>4</sub> .

On the tetrahedron, reflection in a plane containing one edge (and passing through the mid point of the opposite edge) swaps a pair of vertices and leaves the other pair fixed and so corresponds to a 2-cycle in <i>S</i><sub>4</sub>. There are indeed 6 such 2-cycles and 6 edges to choose from !
<p align=justify>
Take one of the three line joining centres of opposite edges. Then a rotatory reflection (by &#177;&#960;/2) about this axis is a symmetry of the tetrahedron, and there are 6 of them -- corresponding to the 6 4-cycles in <i>S</i><sub>4</sub>.<br>
The above account for all 12 of the <i>odd</i> permutations in <i>S</i><sub>4</sub>.
