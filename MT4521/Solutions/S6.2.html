All the opposite symmetries of the dodecahedron are <i>rotatory inversions</i>. That is, they are of the form <i>J</i> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/comp.gif" alt = "comp"> <i>R</i> with <i>R</i> a rotation. <br>
Hence by Exercises 4 question 4 they are all rotatory reflections. The only ones which are actually reflections are those of the form <i>J</i> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/comp.gif" alt = "comp"> <i>H</i> with <i>H</i> a half turn and the only half-turns which are rotatory symmetries of the dodecahedron have axes joining the centres of pairs of opposite edges.<br>
There are 15 such pairs and the reflections are then in the planes through the mid-points perpendicular to these pairs of edges.
