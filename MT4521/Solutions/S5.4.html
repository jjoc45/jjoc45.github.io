The 5-cycles all have order 5 in <i>A</i><sub>5</sub> and so correspond to rotations by multiples of 2&#960;/5. There are (5&#215;4&#215;3&#215;2)/5 = 24 of these in <i>A</i><sub>5</sub> and on the dodecahedron there are 6 axes joining centres of pentagonal faces and 4 non-trivial rotations for each of them.<br>
The 3-cycles all have order 3 in <i>A</i><sub>5</sub> and so correspond to rotations by multiples of 2&#960;/3. There are (5&#215;4&#215;3)/3 = 20 of these in <i>A</i><sub>5</sub> and on the dodecahedron there are 10 axes joining pairs of opposite vertices and 2 non-trivial rotations for each of them.<br>
There are [(5&#215;4)/2&#215;(3&#215;2)/2]/2 = 15 permutations of shape: (**)(**) in <i>A</i><sub>5</sub> and they have order 2 so correspond to rotations by multiples of &#960;. On the dodecahedron there are indeed 15 axes joining centres of opposite edges and one non-trivial rotation for each of them.
