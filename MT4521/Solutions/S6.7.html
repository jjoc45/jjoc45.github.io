<img src= ../Diagrams/xS6-2.gif align = right>The picture shows that if one has an array of octahedra (four are seen from above in the diagram on the right) then one may add four tetrahedra between them (the dotted lines are the top edges) to form a "well" into which another layer of octahedra can be fitted.
<p align=justify>
If you think about the portion shown in the diagram: <img src= ../Diagrams/xS6-3.gif align = middle> you should notice that when you put in the bottom half of the next layer of octahedra, the bit you see consists of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> an octahdron, four <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>'s of an octahedron and four <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tetrahedra. So you need <i>twice as many</i> tetrahedra as octahedra.
