Each altitude of the equilateral triangular faces has length &#8730;3. So the area of the base &#8730;3. <br>
To calculate the height of the tetrahedron, consider the triangle <i>ABE</i> containing one side and the midpoint of the opposite side. This triangle contains the altitude <i>h</i> of the tetrahedron and has sides &#8730;3, &#8730;3 and 2. Since the length of the altitude <i>EF</i> is &#8730;2 (by Pythagoras) the area of the triangle is &#8730;2 and since the area is also &#8730;3 /2  <i>h</i> we have <i>h</i> = &#8730;8/&#8730;3. So the volume is 1/3 &#215; &#8730;3 &#215; &#8730;8/&#8730;3  = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> &#8730;8.

<img src= ../Diagrams/xS5-3.gif align = right>Since the "top half" of the octahedron is a pyramid, we may argue similarly to find its height = &#8730;2. Since the base has area 4, the volume of the pyramid is <sup>4</sup>/<sub>3</sub> &#8730;2 and the volume of the octahedron is <sup>8</sup>/<sub>3</sub> &#8730;2.

Cutting 4 small tetrahedra (each with volume <sup>1</sup>/<sub>24</sub> &#8730;8 ) off the bigger one leaves behind a octahedron with edge-length 1 and so this has volume <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> &#8730;8 - <sup>4</sup>/<sub>24</sub> &#8730;8 = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> &#8730;2 which is (as it should be) <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> of the volume calculated above.
