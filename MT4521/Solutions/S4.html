<ol><p><li>Let <i>A</i> be generated by <i>r</i><sub>1</sub> : a rotation by 2&#960;/<i>n</i> about <b>a</b> and let <i>B</i> be generated by <i>r</i><sub>2</sub> : a rotation by 2&#960;/<i>n</i> about <b>b</b>. Let <i>g</i> be any isometry that maps <b>a</b> to <b>b</b>. (for example <i>T</i><sub><b>b-a</b></sub>)<br>
Then <i>r</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>g</i> <sup>-1</sup><i>r</i><sub>1</sub><i>g</i> (just check the fixed point.) and so <i>B</i> = <i>g</i> <sup>-1</sup><i>Ag</i> as required.<br>
By definition the subgroups <i>C</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> are generated by such rotations and so are conjugate.<br>
To prove that any two copies of <i>D</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> are conjugate, suppose that they are generated by rotations about points <b>a</b>, <b>b</b> and reflections in a lines <i>l</i> containing <b>a</b> and <i>m</i> containing <b>b</b>.<br>
This time choose a symmetry which maps <b>a</b>  <img src= "../Symbolgifs/goesto.gif" alt = "goesto"> <b>b</b> and <i>l</i> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/goesto.gif" alt = "goesto"> <i>m</i>  (for example, <i>T</i><sub><b>b-a</b></sub> followed by a suitable rotation about <b>b</b>) and proceed as before.<br>
[Note that Leonardo's Theorem is really a classification of the finite subgroups of <i>O</i>(2) <i>up to conjugacy</i> by elements of <i>O</i>(2) .]<br>
Since conjugation by any element preserves the determinant, we cannot have <i>D</i><sub>1</sub> (determinant = -1) conjugate to <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> (determinant = +1).

<p><li>If a subgroup of <i>I</i>(<b>R</b>) contained translations by arbitrarily small amounts it would not be discrete. Hence there is a translation <i>T</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> by some smallest number <i>m</i>. Then if there is a translation <i>T</i><sub><i>k</i></sub> by an amount which was not a multiple of <i>m</i>, we could write <i>k</i> = <i>am</i> + <i>r</i> with |<i>r</i>| &lt; |<i>m</i>| and <i>T</i><sub><i>r</i></sub> would also be in the subgroup, giving a contradiction.
<p align=justify>

<p><li>If the subgroup is generated by the smallest translation <i>T</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> then it is an infinite cyclic group <i>C</i><sub>&#8734;</sub> (<img src= "../Symbolgifs/iso.gif" alt = "iso"> <b>Z</b> under +). <br>
Otherwise it will also contain a reflection and conjugating this reflection by the smallest translation will give a reflection in a different point and it may then be generated by these two reflections whose product will be the translation.

The frieze groups (i) and (ii) are each generated by a single element of infinite order and hence are <img src= "../Symbolgifs/iso.gif" alt = "iso"> <i>C</i><sub>&#8734;</sub>. <br>
Note that although the two subgroups are isomorphic as groups, they are not conjugate subgroups in the group of all symmetries of the strip.<br>
The group (iii) is generated by a translation and an element of order 2 (reflection in the horizontal) which commutes with the translation and hence is <i>C</i><sub>&#8734;</sub> &#215; <i>D</i><sub>1</sub>.<br>
The group (iv) is generated by a pair of reflections (one through the centre of each symmetric motif and the other between each pair of motifs). <br>
The group (v) is generated by a pair of elements of order 2 (this time half turns, one about the centre of each motif and the other about a point between each pair of motifs). <br>
The group (vi) is generated by a pair of elements of order 2 (a reflection through the centre of each motif and a half turn about a point between each pair of motifs). <br>
The group (vii) is generated by the same pair of elements as in any of the previous three cases (giving the group <i>D</i><sub>&#8734;</sub>) together with reflection in the horizontal which commutes with everything else. Hence the group is <img src= "../Symbolgifs/iso.gif" alt = "iso"> <i>D</i><sub>&#8734;</sub> &#215; <i>D</i><sub>1</sub>.

<p><li>Inversion in <b><i>a</i></b> is a rotatory reflection: reflection in any plane followed by rotation by &#960; about an axis perpendicular to the plane.<br>
Following this with a rotation about the same axis gives a rotatory reflection. Hence any rotatory inversion is a rotatory reflection.<br>
The converse works similarly.

<p><li><ol type=i><li i> To check the homomorphism property <i>&#952;</i>(<i>AB</i>) = <i>&#952;</i>(<i>A</i>) <i>&#952;</i>(<i>B</i>) for all <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> &#8712; <i>O</i>(3) we must verify that <i>det</i>(<i>AB</i>) <i>AB</i> = <i>det</i>(<i>A</i>) <i>A</i> <i>det</i>(<i>B</i>) <i>B</i> and that <i>det</i>(<i>AB</i>) = <i>det</i>(<i>A</i>) <i>det</i>(<i>B</i>). The second of these is the standard property of the determinant while the first follows from the fact that multiplication by the scalar <i>det</i>(<i>B</i>) (which is &#177;1) commutes with the matrix <i>A</i>.<br>
It is easy to check that <i>&#952;</i> is a bijection.

<li ii>The full symmetry group of <i>X</i> (which is a subgroup of <i>O</i>(3)) is mapped by <i>&#952;</i> to a subgroup of <i>SO</i>(3) &#215; &lt; <i>J</i> >.<br>
[Note that <i>&#952;</i>(<i>J</i>) = (<i>I</i>, -1) which is why we take <i>J</i> as the generator of the second factor.]<br>
This subgroup is the group <i>S</i><sub><i>d</i></sub>(<i>X</i>) &#215; &lt; <i>J</i> >.<br>
</ol><br>

<p><li>The twelve points are (&#177;<i>a</i>, &#177;1, 0), (0, &#177;<i>a</i>, &#177;1), (&#177;1, 0, &#177;<i>a</i>). We may take <i>A</i> to be (1, 0, <i>a</i>), <i>B</i> to be (-1, 0, <i>a</i>) and <i>C</i> to be (0, -<i>a</i>, 1).<br>
Then the distance <i>AB</i> is 2 and (distance <i>AC</i>)<sup>2</sup> = 1 + <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> + (<i>a</i> - 1)<sup>2</sup> = 2(<i>a</i><sup>2</sup> - <i>a</i> +1). So these are the same if <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> - <i>a</i> +1 = 2. i.e if <i>a</i> is the Golden Ratio.<br>
These twelve points can then be used to define 20 equilateral triangles which make up the icosahedron.<br>
