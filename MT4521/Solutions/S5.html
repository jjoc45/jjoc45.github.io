<ol><p><li>The dual of the rhombic dodecahedron has 6 square faces and 8 triangular faces. It is the <i>cuboctahedron</i>.
<p align=justify>
The dual of the truncated octahedron has 24 triangular faces which careful consideration shows to come together to form 12 rhomboidal faces and so the dual is the <i>rhombic dodecahedron</i>.
<p align=justify>
The truncated octahedron and and the rhombic dodecahedron are particularly important because copies of them can be used to fill up <b>R</b><sup>3</sup> without any gaps. Consequently, they appear "in nature" as crystals of various chemical compounds. With the obvious exception of the cube, none of the other Platonic solids can do this.

<p><li><img src= ../Diagrams/xS5-1.gif align = right>The stella octangula has 24 faces, 8 vertices with 3 incident edges and 6 vertices with 8 incident edges. Hence its dual solid has 24 vertices, 8 triangular faces and 6 octagonal faces. It is a truncated cube:
<p align=justify>
Hence the symmetry groups of the stella octangular are the same as those of the cube/octahedron.<br>
<i>S</i><sub><i>d</i></sub> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/iso.gif" alt = "iso"> <i>S</i><sub>4</sub> and <i>S</i> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/iso.gif" alt = "iso"> <i>S</i><sub>4</sub> &#215; &lt; <i>J</i> &gt; .<br>
<br clear=right><br>
Colouring the two tetrahedra differently reduces the symmetry groups to those of the tetrahedron: <i>S</i><sub><i>d</i></sub> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/iso.gif" alt = "iso"> <i>A</i><sub>4</sub> and <i>S</i> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/iso.gif" alt = "iso"> <i>S</i><sub>4</sub>. <br>
Colouring the top and bottom of the dual truncated cube differently from the others will give a figure whose rotational symmetry group <i>S</i><sub><i>d</i></sub> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/iso.gif" alt = "iso"> <i>D</i><sub>4</sub> (the rotational symmetries of the square half-way up) and whose full symmetry group is <i>S</i> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/iso.gif" alt = "iso"> <i>D</i><sub>4</sub> &#215; &lt; <i>J</i> &gt; .<br>
Colouring the upper and lower faces or edges of the stellar octangula will have the same effect.
<p align=justify>

<p><li>(a) To get <i>C</i><sub>4</sub> as a symmetry group, put a symbol like <img src= ../Diagrams/x08-3.gif align = middle> whose 2-dimensional symmetry group is <i>C</i><sub>4</sub> on (say) the top face. <br>
(If you like, you can put its mirror image on the bottom face, but if you use the symbol on the bottom <i>without</i> reflecting it you'll get a <i>D</i><sub>4</sub>.)<br>
(b) Paint each pair of opposite faces the same colour and you'll get a <i>D</i><sub>2</sub>.<br>
(c) Paint a line on the top face and then rotate the cube by the appropriate amounts for <i>A</i><sub>4</sub> and paint the other faces to match what you get. (That's really the same as Question 2 above.)
<p align=justify>
<b>Question</b>: Can you mark a cube to get a <i>D</i><sub>3</sub> ? <b>Hint</b>: <i>D</i><sub>3</sub> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/iso.gif" alt = "iso"> <i>S</i><sub>3</sub> and remember what are permuted when you get the group <i>S</i><sub><i>d</i></sub>(<i>C</i>) as <i>S</i><sub>4</sub> .
<p align=justify>
On the tetrahedron, reflection in a plane containing one edge (and passing through the mid point of the opposite edge) swaps a pair of vertices and leaves the other pair fixed and so corresponds to a 2-cycle in <i>S</i><sub>4</sub>. There are indeed 6 such 2-cycles and 6 edges to choose from !
<p align=justify>
Take one of the three line joining centres of opposite edges. Then a rotatory reflection (by &#177;&#960;/2) about this axis is a symmetry of the tetrahedron, and there are 6 of them -- corresponding to the 6 4-cycles in <i>S</i><sub>4</sub>.<br>
The above account for all 12 of the <i>odd</i> permutations in <i>S</i><sub>4</sub>.
<p align=justify>

<p><li>The 5-cycles all have order 5 in <i>A</i><sub>5</sub> and so correspond to rotations by multiples of 2&#960;/5. There are (5&#215;4&#215;3&#215;2)/5 = 24 of these in <i>A</i><sub>5</sub> and on the dodecahedron there are 6 axes joining centres of pentagonal faces and 4 non-trivial rotations for each of them.<br>
The 3-cycles all have order 3 in <i>A</i><sub>5</sub> and so correspond to rotations by multiples of 2&#960;/3. There are (5&#215;4&#215;3)/3 = 20 of these in <i>A</i><sub>5</sub> and on the dodecahedron there are 10 axes joining pairs of opposite vertices and 2 non-trivial rotations for each of them.<br>
There are [(5&#215;4)/2&#215;(3&#215;2)/2]/2 = 15 permutations of shape: (**)(**) in <i>A</i><sub>5</sub> and they have order 2 so correspond to rotations by multiples of &#960;. On the dodecahedron there are indeed 15 axes joining centres of opposite edges and one non-trivial rotation for each of them.

<p><li><img src= ../Diagrams/xS5-2.gif align = right>(We use edge-length 2 to make the arithmetic easier)<br>
Each altitude of the equilateral triangular faces has length &#8730;3. So the area of the base &#8730;3. <br>
To calculate the height of the tetrahedron, consider the triangle <i>ABE</i> containing one side and the midpoint of the opposite side. This triangle contains the altitude <i>h</i> of the tetrahedron and has sides &#8730;3, &#8730;3 and 2. Since the length of the altitude <i>EF</i> is &#8730;2 (by Pythagoras) the area of the triangle is &#8730;2 and since the area is also &#8730;3 /2  <i>h</i> we have <i>h</i> = &#8730;8/&#8730;3. So the volume is 1/3 &#215; &#8730;3 &#215; &#8730;8/&#8730;3  = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> &#8730;8.
<p align=justify>
<img src= ../Diagrams/xS5-3.gif align = right>Since the "top half" of the octahedron is a pyramid, we may argue similarly to find its height = &#8730;2. Since the base has area 4, the volume of the pyramid is <sup>4</sup>/<sub>3</sub> &#8730;2 and the volume of the octahedron is <sup>8</sup>/<sub>3</sub> &#8730;2.
<p align=justify>
Cutting 4 small tetrahedra (each with volume <sup>1</sup>/<sub>24</sub> &#8730;8 ) off the bigger one leaves behind a octahedron with edge-length 1 and so this has volume <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> &#8730;8 - <sup>4</sup>/<sub>24</sub> &#8730;8 = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> &#8730;2 which is (as it should be) <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> of the volume calculated above.
