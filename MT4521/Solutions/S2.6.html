If &#916;<i>ABC</i> and  &#916;<i>A</i>'<i>B</i>'<i>C</i>' are congruent "in the same sense" then they are related by a direct symmetry.<br>
If <i>A</i> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/goesto.gif" alt = "goesto"> <i>A</i>' under a rotation about a point <i>P</i> then <i>P</i> lies on the perpendicular bisector of <i>AA</i>'. Hence the three perpendicular bisectors would be coincident at <i>P</i>.<br>
If the triangles were related by a translation then the three perpendicular bisectors would be parallel.<br>
If the triangles were related by a glide reflection or reflection, then the midpoints of <i>AA</i>', <i>BB</i>' and <i>CC</i>' would all lie on the "mirror line".<br>
