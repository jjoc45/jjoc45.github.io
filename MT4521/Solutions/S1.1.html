(a) Given a segment <i>AB</i> draw a circle centre <i>A</i> through <i>B</i> and a circle centre <i>B</i> through <i>A</i>. They meet in points <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>. Then the meet of <i>CD</i> and <i>AB</i> is the required midpoint. In fact the line <i>CD</i> is the <i>perpendicular bisector</i> of <i>AB</i>.<br>
(b) Given an angle at <i>A</i>, draw a circle centre <i>A</i> to cut off two segments <i>AB</i> and <i>AC</i> on the sides defining the angle. Use (a) to find the midpoint <i>D</i> of <i>BC</i> and <i>AD</i> is then the angle bisector.<br>
(c) Given a point <i>A</i> on the line, use the compass to mark off two points <i>B</i>, <i>C</i> on the line equidistant from <i>A</i>. Then draw the perpendicular bisector of <i>BC</i> as in (a) above.<br>
(d) Given a point <i>A</i> not on the line <i>BC</i>. Draw a circle centre <i>A</i> through <i>B</i> which then meets the line at points <i>B</i> and (say) <i>D</i>. Then construct the perpendicular bisector of <i>BD</i>.<br>
(e) Draw a perpendicular <i>AB</i> from the point <i>A</i> to the line and then take the line <i>AC</i> perpendicular to <i>AB</i>.<br>
(f) Draw the perpendicular bisectors of <i>AB</i> and <i>AC</i>. These meet in a point <i>O</i>. Then the circle centre <i>O</i> through <i>A</i> passes through <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> also.<br>
(g) (A tricky one!) Draw any line through <i>A</i> not containing the segment <i>AB</i>. Mark off three equal segments <i>AC</i>, <i>CD</i>, <i>DE</i> on the line. Join <i>EB</i>. Draw two lines parallel to <i>EB</i> through <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> and these will meet <i>AB</i> at points dividing it equally.<br>
Clearly a similar method could be used to divide <i>AB</i> up into any number of equal subintervals.<br>
(h) Given the segment <i>AB</i>, draw a circle centre <i>A</i> through <i>B</i>. Then marking off three points on the circle with the same radius gives the opposite end <i>C</i> of the diameter through <i>B</i>. So the line <i>AB</i> has been extended to <i>CB</i>.<br>
This is equivalent to building up a network of equilateral triangles!
