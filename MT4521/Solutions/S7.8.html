<img src= ../Diagrams/xS7-8.gif align = right>If you think of the cards as extending out to the faces of a cube, you get the picture on the right.<br>
So (as in Exercises 5 Question 3(c)) the rotational symmetry group is <i>A</i><sub>4</sub> (consisting of three rotations by &#960; about the centres of faces and 8 rotations by &#177;2&#960;/3 about the diagonals (but no rotations by &#177;&#960;/2 about the faces or rotations about the centres of edges).<br>
Since the figure has central symmetry, the full rotation group is <i>A</i><sub>4</sub> &#215; &lt; J >.
