If the subgroup is generated by the smallest translation <i>T</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> then it is an infinite cyclic group <i>C</i><sub>&#8734;</sub> (<img src= "../Symbolgifs/iso.gif" alt = "iso"> <b>Z</b> under +). <br>
Otherwise it will also contain a reflection and conjugating this reflection by the smallest translation will give a reflection in a different point and it may then be generated by these two reflections whose product will be the translation.

The frieze groups (i) and (ii) are each generated by a single element of infinite order and hence are <img src= "../Symbolgifs/iso.gif" alt = "iso"> <i>C</i><sub>&#8734;</sub>. <br>
Note that although the two subgroups are isomorphic as groups, they are not conjugate subgroups in the group of all symmetries of the strip.<br>
The group (iii) is generated by a translation and an element of order 2 (reflection in the horizontal) which commutes with the translation and hence is <i>C</i><sub>&#8734;</sub> &#215; <i>D</i><sub>1</sub>.<br>
The group (iv) is generated by a pair of reflections (one through the centre of each symmetric motif and the other between each pair of motifs). <br>
The group (v) is generated by a pair of elements of order 2 (this time half turns, one about the centre of each motif and the other about a point between each pair of motifs). <br>
The group (vi) is generated by a pair of elements of order 2 (a reflection through the centre of each motif and a half turn about a point between each pair of motifs). <br>
The group (vii) is generated by the same pair of elements as in any of the previous three cases (giving the group <i>D</i><sub>&#8734;</sub>) together with reflection in the horizontal which commutes with everything else. Hence the group is <img src= "../Symbolgifs/iso.gif" alt = "iso"> <i>D</i><sub>&#8734;</sub> &#215; <i>D</i><sub>1</sub>.
