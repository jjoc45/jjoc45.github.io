<h2><font color=blue>Topological Motivation</font></h2>
<p>
The idea of a metric allows us to apply analytical ideas to a variety of spaces. However, as Example 2 on Exercises 2 shows, different metrics sometimes lead to "the same analysis" (that is, to the same convergent sequences and consequently the same continuous functions). So, in a way, we demand too much information when we insist that we have a metric on a space.
<p align=justify>
It often happens that when we construct new spaces by "gluing things together" (like M&ouml;bius bands, real projective planes, complexes of various sorts) having to provide a metric on them is often difficult, sometimes impossible and always irrelevant.
<p align=justify>
Also, for some purposes, metric spaces do not let us do everything we want. For example, the idea of pointwise convergence of a sequence of functions in (say) <i>C</i>[0, 1] does not corespaond to convergence in any metric. To handle a situation like this needs a more general structure.<br>
