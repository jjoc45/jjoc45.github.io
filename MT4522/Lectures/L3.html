<h2><font color=blue>Some topological ideas</font></h2>
<p>
Before we look at the formal definitions of metric spaces and their generalisations we will consider some naive examples which lie at the base of some topological considerations. <br>
The basic idea behind topology is the concept of a continuous function. <br>
<ol>
<li 1>For example <img src= ../Diagrams/x3-1.gif align = middle> is the graph of a continuous function on the interval (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) of <b>R</b><br>
while <img src= ../Diagrams/x3-2.gif align = middle> is the graph of a function with a discontinuity at <i>c</i>.<br>
This intuitive concept needs a bit of tinkering to make it rigorous. 
<p align=justify>
<li 2>For maps from <b>R</b><sup>2</sup> to <b>R</b><sup>2</sup>  which are transformations of the plane: <br>
A continuous map stretches but does not to tear. Think of crumpling up the plane and then flattening it down. <br>
You could even stretch it (a finite amount). The important thing is that close points are mapped to close points. <br>
If you "tear" the plane, points which were close together on either side of the tear will be ripped apart and may not end up close: that is a discontinuity. <br>
We will make all this at rigorous later. 
<p align=justify>
<li 3>If you can stretch one subset <i>A</i> of (say) <b>R</b><sup>3</sup> into another one <i>B</i>, using a continuous map and vice-versa, we will say that <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are <b>topologically equivalent</b> or (technical term) <b>homeomorphic</b>. <br>
Again, we will make of this at rigorous later, but here are some examples: <br>
<ol type=a>
<li a><img src= ../Diagrams/x3-3.gif align = middle>
<p align=justify>
<li b><img src= ../Diagrams/x3-4.gif align = middle>
<p align=justify>
<li c><img src= ../Diagrams/x3-5.gif align = middle> in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>.
<p align=justify>
But (amazingly) if you removed each of these knots from <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>, the sets that are left are <i>not</i> homeomorphic. <br>
It is things like this last example that spurred it topologists on to classification of things like knots. 
<p align=justify>
<li d>The map&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src= ../Diagrams/x3-6.gif align = middle>&nbsp;&nbsp;from the interval (0, 2<font face=symbol>p</font>] in <b>R</b> to the unit circle in <b>C</b> given by <i>t</i> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/goesto.gif" alt = "goesto"> <i>e</i><sup><i>it</i></sup> is a continuous one-one map. It has a well-defined inverse.<br>
What stops it being a homeomorphism? <br>
<b>Answer</b>: the inverse map is <i>not</i> continuous at 1. <br>
"Sticking the things" together means that you would have to tear them apart to define the inverse. <br>
</ol></ol>
