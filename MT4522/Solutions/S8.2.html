Open sets are the usual ones together with those of the form [<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) or [<i>a</i>, <img src= "../Symbolgifs/infinity.gif" alt = "infinity">) and those made using these.<br>
So the closed sets are the usual ones together with [<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>), (-<img src= "../Symbolgifs/infinity.gif" alt = "infinity">, <i>a</i>) and those made by combining them, Hence the only extra ones are open as well and so the separation cannot be done.<br>
<b><font color=red>Remark</font></b><br>
The really amazing thing about this example is that the product of this space with itself is <i>not</i> normal.
