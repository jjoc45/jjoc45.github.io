This is the construction of the additive quotient group <b>R</b>/<b>Q</b>. Any real number <i>x</i> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/belongs.gif" alt = "belongs"> <b>R</b> can be written as <i>n</i> + <i>f</i> with <i>n</i> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/belongs.gif" alt = "belongs"> <b>Z</b> and <i>f</i> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/belongs.gif" alt = "belongs"> (0, 1). So the interval (0, 1) maps to the whole of <b>R</b>/~. <br>
Similarly for any other open interval.<br>
The open sets of the identification topology are the images of open sets in <b>R</b>. Since any non-empty open set of <b>R</b> contains an open interval, it will map to the whole of <b>R</b>/~. Hence <b>R</b>/~ (which is an uncountable set and hence can be put into one-one correspondence with <b>R</b>) has only itself and <img src= "../Symbolgifs/empty.gif" alt = "empty"> as open sets.<br>
Thus, up to homeomorphism, it is the same as <b>R</b> with the trivial topology.
