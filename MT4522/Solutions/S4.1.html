<p>

In a discrete metric space (where <i>d</i>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) = 1 if <i>x</i> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/noteq.gif" alt = "noteq"> <i>y</i>) a <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> -neighbourhood of a point <i>p</i> is the singleton set {<i>p</i>}. Thus since every singleton is open and any subset <i>A</i> is the union of all the singleton sets of points in <i>A</i> we get the result that every subset is open.<br>
Since all the complements are open too, every set is also closed.<img src= ../Diagrams/xproofend.gif align = right><br clear=right><br>
Since all inverse images are open, every function <i>from</i> a discrete space is continuous.<img src= ../Diagrams/xproofend.gif align = right><br clear=right><br>
If <i>f</i>: <b>R</b> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/rarrow.gif" alt = "rarrow"> <i>X</i> is continuous and <i>X</i> is discrete, this means that the inverse image of every singleton set is open. But then we cannot have any interval (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) which is mapped to more than one point. Hence the only continuous functions are constant ones.<img src= ../Diagrams/xproofend.gif align = right><br clear=right>
