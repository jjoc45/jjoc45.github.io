Note that the boundary of <i>A</i> is a pair of circles -- linked non-trivially. Thus <i>A</i> is the same as a "twisted cylinder" (Question 1 above)<br>
Reversing the twist on one of the strips gives a surface with two <i>unlinked</i> circles as boundary. This is an ordinary cylinder in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>.
<p align=justify>
The space <i>B</i> is trickier. Its boundary is a single circle in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup> which happens to be knotted.<br>
Unlikely as it may seem, <i>B</i> is a torus with a disc removed to make a hole.<br>
To see this, snip two of the twisted strips: <img src= ../Diagrams/xS7-8.gif align = middle> and convince yourself that this is the same as a torus with a hole:<br>
 <img src= ../Diagrams/xS7-9.gif align = middle><br>
Reversing a twist makes no difference (think how the identifications are made) while if one of the strips is untwisted <i>A</i> is a Mobius band and <i>B</i> is a cylinder with a hole.<br>
