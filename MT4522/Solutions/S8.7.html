The space <b>R</b> = (-<img src= "../Symbolgifs/infinity.gif" alt = "infinity">, <i>a</i>) <img src= "../Symbolgifs/union.gif" alt = "union"> [<i>a</i>, <img src= "../Symbolgifs/infinity.gif" alt = "infinity">) and so is disconnected. Its components are singleton sets since if <i>x</i> <img src= "../Symbolgifs/noteq.gif" alt = "noteq"> <i>y</i> we can take <i>a</i> between them and disconnect them by sets like those above.
<p align=justify>
(i) In the cofinite topology <b>R</b> is connected since the only proper closed subsets are finite ones.
<p align=justify>
(ii) Similarly, <b>R</b> is connected in the co-countable topology.
