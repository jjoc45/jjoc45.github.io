<p>

Any open interval (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) in <b>R</b> can be written as a union of <img src= "../Symbolgifs/epsilon.gif" alt = "epsilon">-neighbourhoods of rational points with <img src= "../Symbolgifs/epsilon.gif" alt = "epsilon"> rational by taking ssuitable rational sequences converging to <i>a</i> (from above) and <i>b</i> (from below). Since these intervals form a basis the rational neighbourhoods do too. There are only countably many of these.<br>
Every basis for the discrete topology must contain all the "singleton" sets and so is uncountable.
