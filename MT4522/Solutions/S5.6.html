<p>

Every singleton subset {<i>n</i>} is closed and hence every finite union of such sets is closed also. Hence every finite subset is closed and so every finite set is open in the subspace topology which is therefore discrete.

In the cofinite topology on <b>R</b>, the subset 2<b>Z</b> is not closed and hence it is not closed in the subspace topology on <b>Z</b>. So the topology on <b>Z</b> is not discrete
